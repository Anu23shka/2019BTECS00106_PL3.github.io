		<p>An environment is a sole factor for the existence of life on earth. Without it, there can be no life on earth. In our solar system, there are other big planets but have no life due to a lack of environment.<br>Hence, even scientists are working on only Mars to create life on it as it has some suitable environment.  This shows the importance of the environment for life & existence.<br>In a study conducted by the American Institutes for Research, a group of sixth graders attended outdoor school for six weeks, while another group did not. During the outdoor programme, students carried out hands-on activities such as searching for aquatic insects in a stream and identifying tree species, as well as drawing conclusions on the “health” of a forest. At the end of the programme, the students, teachers and parents were surveyed. 
        <br>The group that participated in the outdoor education rated better in self-esteem, conflict resolution, relationship with peers, problem-solving, motivation to learn and behaviour in class. These children also had improved Science scores, measured by a pre and post test.</p>
